# AI-Powered-Stock-Market-Predictor
AI-Powered Stock Market Predictor This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. It fetches stock data via the Yahoo Finance API, preprocesses it, trains the model, and visualizes the actual vs predicted stock prices on a graph.

# AI-Powered Stock Market Predictor

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is built with TensorFlow and trained on historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` API.

## Features
- Fetches stock data via Yahoo Finance.
- Preprocesses the data for time series forecasting.
- Uses LSTM layers to predict future stock prices.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices on a graph.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- yfinance

Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance


How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Powered-Stock-Market-Predictor.git
cd AI-Powered-Stock-Market-Predictor

Run the Python script:
python stock_predictor.py

How It Works
Data Collection: Fetches stock data using yfinance for a specified company (e.g., AAPL).
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes the data and creates sequences to train the LSTM model.
Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on the stock data to predict future prices.
Prediction & Visualization: The model predicts stock prices, and results are plotted to compare actual vs predicted values.
